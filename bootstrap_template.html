                <p> For over a century, baseball has been America’s sport, with the first World Series taking place in 1903, providing 30 teams housing players with hundreds of different backgrounds. A common activity most fans love to take part in is visiting every MLB ballpark, experiencing the game day atmospheres for each team, walking around the stadium and of course diving into the unique concessions each ballpark offers. When it comes to concessions, hot dogs, peanuts and hamburgers are all popular options for fans, but another one of the most purchased concessions has seen recent rises in prices at most MLB stadiums: Beer. </p>
                <p>For sports fans, beer is one of the most popular concessions purchased at not only MLB ballparks, but all professional sports stadiums. In the National Football League, an article from <a href= "https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-infuriating-saga-of-the-15-ballpark-beer">Mel Magazine</a> stated that “beer jumped one whole dollar, from $5.83 to $6.80. After that, it gradually increased about 15 cents per year, give or take, getting to $8.17 in 2018.” It is safe to say that most fans want to enjoy a little (or a lot in some cases) bit of their favorite beer during a sunny day at the ballpark, but why are the prices of the beers so expensive? </p>

                <p>In data of MLB beer prices from 2013-2018, we can see trends in how prices rise and fall depending on how good a team is, how new a stadium is and even certain divisions driving in higher beer prices than others. Beers at Major League baseball stadiums used to be as low as 60 cents, but have sky-rocketed to almost $11 if we look at numbers across the league. For example, looking at MLB beer prices from 2013-2018, the New York Mets saw their smallest size beers reach $10.50 a drink in 2018, only three years after the team made the World Series. Also, New York holds one of the biggest sports markets in the world with the New York Yankees also holding a team in the city. </p>

                    <h3> <span class= "badge bg-secondary"> $15 for a Miller "High Price" Lite? </h3>
                        <p> Of course, rising beer prices did not start in 2013, it has been a gradual process that reportedly started in the 1990’s.  According to the same article from <a href= "https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-infuriating-saga-of-the-15-ballpark-beer">Mel Magazine</a>, the building of new stadiums in the 1990’s, for example Camden Yards in Baltimore, made the experience of going to baseball stadiums more for entertainment rather than watching a baseball game. </p>
                        <p>The articles continues saying “They [MLB owners] weren’t just trying to sell you baseball anymore — they were trying to sell you an <i> experience </i>, with the stadium offering more shopping and other stuff to do besides watching a game.” </p>
                        <p> Not only are experts seeing a change in beer prices, but also the fans and season ticket holders, who are already spending big bucks for tickets and parking. Benson Fechter, a season ticket holder for the Pittsburgh Pirates, has several thoughts on why beer prices and other concession prices are now soaring through the roof. </p>
                        <p>“As someone who goes to 40 plus games per year, if you are spending $15 on a beer that really does add up.” Fechter said. “For me, I usually like getting a hotdog and a drink at games, but this alone can cost $10 and can be a $500 plus expense over the course of the season.”</p>
                        <p> If you do the math, a beer, another drink and a hotdog at a Major League Baseball game can go upwards of $25 dollars, an insane price for three simple concessions. According to numbers I compiled from this <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Tdp5Fpogb9rSz0KZ6TPw5diS2p93U-t0Lx7odk90LA/edit?usp=sharing">Data World</a> dataset, Fenway Park charged $8 for a 12 ounce beer in 2018, amounting to 67 cents per ounce of beer, an insane stat to think about when you take into account stadium beers used to be as low as 65 cents. </p>
                        <p> Below, you can see a chart showing the increase in price per ounce in beer from 2013-2018, showing how expensive ballpark beers are nowadays. </p>

                    <h3> <span class= "badge bg-secondary"> How do Current MLB Beer Prices Stack Up? </h3>
                    <p>Fechter believes that beer and overall concession prices may continue to rise, but the owners of these MLB teams may not have a choice other than to progressively raise prices to guage money from customers. </p>
                    <p>“MLB beer prices are rising simply because of the fact that there is nowhere you can go inside the stadium to get a beer except from the concession stand themselves,” Fechter said. “Owners can get away with it simply because of that fact.” </p>
                    <p>Data from <a href= "https://blog.cheapism.com/mlb-hot-dog-beer-prices/">Cheapism</a> shows the current 2022 MLB beer prices for all 30 teams, showing how prices are now closing in on $12 for a team’s smallest beer size. The New York Mets smallest size beer clocks in at $11.75, with the price of a hot dog sitting at $7. One trend I have noticed is that bigger market teams seem to be generating higher prices, with smaller revenue-generating teams like the Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays only charging $5 for their smallest beer sizes.</p>

                    <h3> <span class= "badge bg-secondary"> Will Prices Continue to Rise?</h3>
                    <p>Big market teams, like the Mets, are breaking the bank, still charging over $7 for a crisp stadium beer, but despite these big market teams charging big dollars for their concessions Fechter thinks the experience of being in the stadium is what draws fans to the games on some occasions.</p>
                    <p>“I do think that owners to a certain extent are prioritizing the experience over baseball,” Fechter said. “The experience is what draws some fans to the stadium when the team isn’t performing at their highest.”</p>
                    <p> Small-market teams have trouble drawing fans most years because of their lackluster talent and less spending money, leading to the owners of those teams to stockpile more money into the stadium experience. Based on trends in data, if a team is performing well, they are going to raise concession prices since more fans are attending games. </p>
                    <p> It is possible that prices will continue to rise, but it honestly depends on how teams compete in the future, if teams are given new stadiums and the amount of fans that are attending MLB games. If we base our estimates on the future with our current data, it is safe to assume that beer prices will be on the rise for the rest of this season and for future years in Major League Baseball. </p>

My live source was Benson Fechter, a season ticket holder for the Major League Baseball team the Pittsburgh Pirates. I wanted to choose this topic as my research because I attend a lot of MLB games, and noticed rising prices in concessions over the last couple years, especially in beer prices. I thought it was a topic not a lot of people touch on, despite millions of fans attending MLB games every year.
